# js-webdriverIO-appium-allure

This project provides the ability to integrate webdriverIO into the Continuous Integration (CI) process, allowing mobile Android and iOS tests to be run automatically. The results of test execution are processed and presented in the form of a detailed Allure report, which contains full information about each test, including its steps, parameters, answers and possible errors with screenshots, as well as video of the test process stored on [Browserstack](https://app-automate.browserstack.com/builds/038a6d40b2e6b348e02c7c58049f3ce4e46f34ca/sessions/651e4c178c60b63acec40092f5f5373ac2c2e692?auth_token=3780f8d9fe04d0201f7b57b985f16fb83ed90dfe698ab4eab20719c935da36e0). This provides visibility and convenience when analyzing test results, allowing you to quickly identify and fix problems.
